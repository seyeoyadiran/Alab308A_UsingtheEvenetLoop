# Alab308A_UsingtheEventLoop
## Introduction
### This assignment will introduce some practical implementations of event loop and call stack concepts, as well as emphasize some of the common issues a JavaScript developer may run into due to the implementation of these core features.

## Objectives 
- Calculate the maximum size of the jacascript call stack in StackOverFlow.js
- Use Trampolines to handle stack overflow issues caused by recursion in trampolines.js
- Use deferred execution within the event loop to allow the browser to render between calculations.
